- 👋 Hi, my name is Stanislav (@Stats-M)
- 👀 I’m a computer enthusiast with self-education (mostly) in C#, Pascal and Visul Basic (from most current to most ancient ones). Additionally I have learnt at some degree HTML, CSS, SQL, Fortran95, Lua to achieve side targets in the past.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ at Yandex.Practicum to make a step from C# to a more powerful language. Additionally, C++ is used in UEngine which I have some plans for. 
- 💞️ While all my projects was a single-man hobby projects, it will be a pleasure for me to work as a full-time programmer to achive our team goals and develop myself into prefessional.
