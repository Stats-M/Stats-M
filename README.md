- 👋 Hi, my name is Stanislav (@Stats-M)
- 👀 I’m a computer enthusiast with self-education (mostly) in C++, C#, Pascal and Visul Basic (from most current to most ancient ones). Additionally I have learnt at some degree HTML, CSS, SQL, Fortran95, Lua to achieve side targets in the past.
- 🌱 I currently undertake "C++ for experienced programmers" learning course at Yandex.Practicum to make a solid step from C# to a more powerful language. Additionally, C++ is used in UEngine which I have some plans for. 
- 💞️ While all my projects was a single-man hobby projects, I always ready to take an opportunity to make my hobby as my hobby-job. Call me to join your C++ developers team so we can achieve our goals together.
